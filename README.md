## University of Regensburg at CheckThat! 2021:Exploring Text Summarization for Fake NewsDetection

This repository contains all code used in our submission for Task 3a in 2021's CheckThatLab!. Unfortunately, we are not allowed to share the dataset used due to legal reasons, but we wanted to share our method nonetheless. We will add a link to the conference and paper once they are available.
